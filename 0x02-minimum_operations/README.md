# Prime Factorization Operations

This repository contains a Python file that implements a function to calculate the minimum number of operations required to reach a desired count of characters using the prime factorization approach.

## File

- `0-minOperations.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `minOperations` function. The function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the minimum number of operations required to reach a count of `n` characters using the prime factorization approach. The function utilizes the prime factorization of `n` to determine the operations.

## Usage

To use the `minOperations` function, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.

4. Use the function by importing it in your Python script or in a Python interactive session. Here's an example:

   ```python
   minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

   # Example usage
   count = 24
   operations = minOperations(count)
   print(f"The minimum number of operations to reach a count of {count} 'H' characters is {operations}.")
   ```
Output:

The minimum number of operations to reach a count of 24 'H' characters is 9.

In this example, the `minOperations` function is imported, and the minimum number of operations required to reach a count of 24 'H' characters is calculated and printed.
